    <h1>GDPR Statement — Timing Challenge</h1>
    <p>Last updated: <strong>November 18, 2025</strong></p>

    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>This page explains how the Timing Challenge web game uses cookies and other small pieces of information to provide the leaderboard, remember your player name and personal highscores, and improve your experience. It describes what data is collected, why it is used, how long it is kept, and your rights under the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).</p>

    <h2>Data we collect</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Cookies:</strong> small text files stored in your browser to remember consent (e.g. <code>gdprAccepted</code>) and personal highscore cookies (<code>timing_highscore</code>, <code>timing_highscore_ninja</code>).</li>
      <li><strong>Local storage:</strong> your chosen player name is stored in <code>localStorage</code> as <code>timing_playerName</code> to avoid prompting each time.</li>
      <li><strong>Submitted leaderboard data:</strong> when you finish a game we may ask for a player name and submit that name and your score to our server to display global highscores.</li>
      <li><strong>Analytics / server logs:</strong> minimal technical data (IP address, request timestamps) may be logged by the server for abuse prevention and basic metrics. These are not linked to personal profiles within the game.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Why we collect this data</h2>
    <p>The data enables:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Leaderboard functionality (submit and fetch global highscores).</li>
      <li>Remembering your personal highscores and player name locally so you don’t have to re-enter them.</li>
      <li>Storing consent choices (GDPR banner).</li>
      <li>Basic abuse prevention and service monitoring on the server side.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Legal basis</h2>
    <p>We rely on your consent to store cookies that are not strictly necessary (you can withdraw consent at any time). Storage of the player name and highscores in cookies/localStorage is for the legitimate purpose of providing the interactive game experience.</p>

    <h2>Retention</h2>
    <p>Cookies and localStorage items created by the game are set to a reasonable duration (typically one year). Server-side leaderboard entries may be retained longer—contact us for exact retention periods (see contact section).</p>

    <h2>Third parties</h2>
    <p>The game may call a remote API to fetch or submit highscores. This means the submitted player name and score are stored on that server and may be visible publicly as part of the leaderboard. We do not share your player name with advertising networks from within the game.</p>

    <h2>Your rights</h2>
    <p>Under GDPR you have the right to:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Request access to the personal data we hold about you.</li>
      <li>Request correction or deletion of your personal data.</li>
      <li>Withdraw consent to cookie storage (see below for how).</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>How to withdraw consent / delete local data</h2>
    <p>To withdraw consent and remove local data:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Open your browser settings and delete the cookie named <code>gdprAccepted</code> (or use the banner on the site).</li>
      <li>Delete cookies named <code>timing_highscore</code> and <code>timing_highscore_ninja</code> if you wish to remove stored highscores.</li>
      <li>Clear the <code>timing_playerName</code> key from your browser's localStorage to remove the stored name.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>If you want us to remove leaderboard entries stored on the server, please contact us (see below). We will need the player name and an approximate submission date to locate entries.</p>

    <h2>Contact</h2>
    <p>If you have questions about data stored by this game, or wish to request deletion of server-side leaderboard entries, please contact: <strong>webmaster@example.com</strong>.</p>
